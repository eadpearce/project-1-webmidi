### Introduction
*Piano Hero* began as a type of Simon Says game where the computer would play a sequence of notes and the player has to play them back correctly. This game mechanic was easier than expected to implement so I went ahead and added notation and the *Piano Hero* mode which makes the sequence scroll along the manuscript at the top and the player has to play the notes as they reach the cursor a la *Guitar Hero*. It flashes blue and plays a 'ping' sound effect for correct notes, and flashes red for incorrect notes. Code can be found on github here <https://github.com/eadpearce/wdi-project-1> and a live version can be accessed here <https://obscure-atoll-38438.herokuapp.com/>

### Project Brief
* Create a game using everything we've learned in the first 2 weeks of the WDI course.  
* Make it object oriented if possible.  

### Tools Used 
* Audacity 
* Javascript, HTML, CSS 
* jQuery 
* reset.css 


### Future Plans...
There are a lot more features that I would have liked to add, and may add in future, such as:

* A bank of well-known tunes for the computer to play
* Backing tracks
* Fully responsive design, making sure the keys are life-sized for tablets and touchscreens 
* Different samples for the keys 
* More complicated notation (e.g. beamed quavers and sharps/naturals) and different rhythms 
* Animated text when playing a correct/incorrect note
* Animated text showing how many points are being scored 
* MIDI support using WebMidi.js <https://github.com/cotejp/webmidi> 
* Pitch recognition so you can play with a microphone by singing or playing an instrument

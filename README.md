### Introduction
*Piano Hero* began as a type of Simon Says game where the computer would play a sequence of notes and the player has to play them back correctly. This game mechanic was easier than expected to implement so I went ahead and added notation and the *Piano Hero* mode which makes the sequence scroll along the manuscript at the top and the player has to play the notes as they reach the cursor a la *Guitar Hero*. It flashes blue and plays a 'ping' sound effect for correct notes, and flashes red for incorrect notes. Code can be found on github here <https://github.com/eadpearce/wdi-project-1> and a live version can be accessed here <https://obscure-atoll-38438.herokuapp.com/>

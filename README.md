### Introduction
*Piano Hero* began as just a type of Simon Says game where the computer would play a sequence of notes and the player has to play them back correctly. This game mechanic was easier than expected to implement so I went ahead and added notation and the *Piano Hero* mode which makes the sequence scroll along the manuscript at the top and the player has to play the notes as they reach the cursor which will flash blue for correct notes and red for incorrect notes. Code can be found on github here <https://github.com/eadpearce/wdi-project-1> and a live version can be accessed here <
